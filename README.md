Arduino Software for RS485 support with collision detection and message handling capabilities

Michael Jonker 20141221

This project provides a software suite to support the use of an RS485 transceiver connected to the USART (Tx/Rx pins) in a half-duplex, concurrent multi-drop (i.e. multi-master, multi-slave) environment. For this purpose, the software suite has capabilities for message addressing and filtering as well as collision detection and avoidance.
