# Note: because this repository is a 'fine' selection of a much larger file structure in my work directory
# I choose to ignore all
*

# As git does not ignore files specified in .gitignore that are already tracked,
# files can be added to the repository with  git add -f. <file>
# However, for completeness, all what should be in the repository is summed up here.
# note: git is case insensitive to the entries in .gitignore

### not ignored (hence included) are ======================
